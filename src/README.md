## Abstract
This is my first code ever in Rust. I tried to implement 3d graphics rendere,
pipeline in CPU. But during the code development I found out that I am not clever enough
to handle it by myself. But because of it I read really lots of eng articles
about 3d graphics in general, about OpenGL internals and other interesting
stuff. I am proud of my hight ambitions, but I still not ready for this :( 

I haven't finished the project, even though I can tell sth about it's impact to
my professional and personal skills. 

* I got the main concepts of rust-lang. I fell in love with the language. Thx
  for it's nice community, good docs, and everyone who takes a part in
  the language development. 
* I got the main concepts of low-level 3d graphics, renderers structure, bacis
  techniques of rasterization.
* And the last but the most important, it was interesting to me. 

## What I did
You can build my project with cargo and see the scene with 3 rotating cubes. You
cam look around with WASD and moving the mouse.
